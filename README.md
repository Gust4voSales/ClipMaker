## ðŸ“œ About
The user uploads a video and an audio, sets the duration of the clip, optionally selects a filter (old movie, hearts, rain falling etc) and a color filter. That's it, the rest is up to the ClipMaker, which is going to edit a videoclip with random cuts (and transitions in-between) from the uploaded video and with all the other settings set previously.
